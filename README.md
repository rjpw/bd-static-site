# Static Site Generator in Python

This repo is for BOOT.DEV guided project [Build a Static Site Generator in Python](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-static-site-generator-python).

## Observations

The course author guides us toward a decomposition of markdown that vaguely but not completely resembles an abstract syntax tree.

Getting us all the way to an AST by means of a parser might be an interesting exercise after completing this project.
